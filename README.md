# End-to-End E-Commerce Data Engineering Pipeline on Azure

## Project Overview
#### This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a fully dynamic and scalable data pipeline using Microsoft Azure services. The goal was to ingest, transform, and analyze e-commerce sales data efficiently using cloud-native solutions. The entire data lifecycle—from raw ingestion to analytics-ready datasets—was orchestrated using a combination of Azure Data Factory, Azure Databricks, and Azure Synapse Analytics, with final visualizations set up for Power BI.
